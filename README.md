# UML-class-diagram---Computer-Lab-Management-System
Converts a problem statement into class diagram.
## Problem Statement
*"Develop a UML class diagram that models the working of computer labs in your department. It relates Students, Lab Instructor, weekly Lab Tasks, PCs, and Software installed on the PCs. There are two types of software installed i.e. System Software and Application Software. All the PCs are connected through LAN with a server which is being operated by a lab in charge. The lab in charge is also responsible for installation and maintenance of System and Application Software for all the systems in the lab."*

### The tasks to be performed are:
1.	Extract the main objects (entities) for above system.
2.	Find the necessary attributes and functions that need to be associated with each object (You are required to mention at most three attributes and one functions for a class).
3.	Identify the relationships between these objects.
4.	Construct a final comprehensive Class diagram showing all objects and their relationships along with their attributes and functions.

### Important things to consider:
    You have to use standard UML notations for objects, classes, and their associations.

### Note:
Besides problem statement; objects, properties, and functions of a system can also be extracted from domain knowledge. You have to consider all OOP concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, association, generalization, and specialization wherever applicable.
